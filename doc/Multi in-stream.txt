Multi in-stream
===============
 - Commands take a number of argument streams as input. The first stream contains the command line arguments, the subsequent streams are from piped commands.
 - Commands should be able to read the streams a one stream, if so desired, e.g. echo
 - All stream except the command line arguments (cla stream) must be lazy loaded.
 
E.g.
sum 2 2, mult 3 3 | echo test => test 4 9
echo reads the command line argument stream followed by the streams, which are output from the piped commands before.
