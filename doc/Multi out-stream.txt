================
Multi out-stream
================
 - A command can output to any number of streams
 - Since the command is lazy loaded, care needs to be taken to only run through the input stream(s) once, otherwise we may run into some complexity problems
 
E.g.
testdata.txt contains:
1,2,3
4,5,6
7,8,9
EOF
io.readfile testdata.txt | splitby ',' | sum, sum, avg | echo
The file is read line by line into splitby - i.e. splitby will receive 3 aguments from its first piped stream and one from cla stream.
splitby will aplit each argument by the noted delimiter and a each value is given to its respected command on the left of the pipe

Consider making anonymous sub-commands to make more advanced stuff.
E.g.
io.readfile testdata.txt | splitby ',' | (greaterthan 3 | sum), sum, avg | echo
