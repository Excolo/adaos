============
Placeholders
============
Placeholders are sort-of-like lazy loaded variables, where output from one command can be stored and read into another.

E.g.
io.readfile testdata.txt | splitby ',' | into a;
a | stream 1 | sum | into b;
a | stream 2 | sum | into b;
a | stream 3 | avg | into b;
b | echo
Would be the same as:
io.readfile testdata.txt | splitby ',' | sum, sum, avg | echo

Consider how these placeholders should be cleared. Will they die after end of execution of one command-sequence or will they live until 'clear x' is called?
